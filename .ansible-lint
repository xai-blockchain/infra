# XAI Ansible Lint Configuration
# This file marks the ansible directory as the project root for ansible-lint

# Profile to use (safety, shared, moderate, production, etc.)
profile: production

# Offline mode - don't make network requests
offline: true

# Skip rules that can't be applied (e.g., templated hosts in migrate playbook)
# Note: syntax-check is unskippable, but the migrate playbook uses templated hosts
# which is expected behavior for migration playbooks

# Exclude patterns
exclude_paths:
  - .cache/
  - playbooks/  # Legacy playbooks, may not meet current standards
  - support_migrate_node.yml  # Uses templated hosts ({{ source_host }}, {{ target_host }}) - validate with: ansible-playbook --syntax-check -e source_host=x -e target_host=y

# Mock roles/collections that aren't installed
mock_roles:
  - xai_node
  - common
  - monitoring
  - nginx

# Use default rules
use_default_rules: true

# Enable all warnings
enable_list:
  - no-changed-when
  - command-instead-of-module
